Use a pre-trained Keras Resnet model to predict an image.

The ResNet50 or Residual Network is a 50 layered deep neural network architecture trained on imagenet dataset.

The keras_resnet.py downloads the pretrained keras resnet50 model and makes prediction on the input image.

The input image fed is a Green apple which is predicted correctly with a confidence of more than 99%.

Along with the correct prediction, the code also displays the top 4 potential predictions made on the test image.
